# C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes), and code in the form of procedures (methods). This approach enhances software design and makes it more modular and easier to maintain.

In C++, we can define our own types using classes. A class defines a blueprint for an object. Objects are instances of a class, and we can create as many as we need. Each object has its own memory space and can have its own state and behavior. This repository is intended to be a comprehensive guide to mastering OOP in C++.
