In this enchanted repository, you'll find ancient scrolls üìö(resources) and mystical artifacts üîÆ (projects) that will guide you through the treacherous landscape of game development. So, strap on your boots, grab your spellbook, and join me on this epic adventure to bring the fascinating worlds of physics, mathematics, and computer science to life through the spellbinding art of game creation! üéÆ

Are you ready to embark on this awe-inspiring journey? Let the adventure begin! üéâ

## Goals

- The goal is to explore the engaging aspects of physics and mathematics by applying them to game development and real-life simulations. I hope this repository can serve as a guide and inspiration for others who are interested in game development. Alternatively, unveil to students how math and physics become more enjoyable when applied to practical scenarios.

- To create a habit of continuous learning and improvement, I commit to making at least one meaningful contribution to the project every single day. This daily commitment will help me stay on track and maintain momentum throughout my game development journey.

- Demonstrate mastery and practical application of each subject by completing at least one project that covers a good portion of the concepts in that subject. This ensures a deeper understanding and hands-on experience with the topics, while also providing tangible results for my learning progress.

## Projects

Here is a list of projects that I've completed during my learning journey. Each project folder contains a README with a brief description, goals, and technologies used.

1. C++ Fundamentals
   - [Project 1](./projects/c++_fundamentals/project1)
   - [Project 2](./projects/c++_fundamentals/project2)

# Utils

This folder contains utility scripts to help the journey.

## gpprun.sh

This script simplifies the process of compiling and running C++ code. With just one command, it compiles your source code using the g++ compiler and then executes the compiled binary.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the g++ compiler installed on your system. You can check if it's installed by running `g++ --version` in your terminal.
- Ensure that the `gpprun.sh` script has execute permissions. You can set the execute permission using `chmod +x gpprun.sh`.

### How to Use

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `gpprun.sh` script.
2. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
./gpprun.sh /path/to/your/source/file.cpp
```

Replace `/path/to/your/source/file.cpp` with the path of C++ source file.

3. The script will compile your code and, if successful, run the compiled binary.

That's it! Now you can easily compile and run your C++ code with a single command.
