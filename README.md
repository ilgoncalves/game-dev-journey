# üöÄ My Epic Game Development Adventure üéÆ

Welcome, fellow adventurer, to the magical realm of game development! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This repository chronicles my thrilling quest to create a game engine from scratch, wielding the mighty powers of C++, mathematics, and physics. Together, we'll explore vast lands of knowledge, uncover hidden secrets, and conquer challenging obstacles on our journey to master the arcane arts of game programming. üåü

In this enchanted repository, you'll find ancient scrolls ÔøΩ (resources) and mystical artifacts üîÆ (projects) that will guide you through the treacherous landscape of game development. So, strap on your boots, grab your spellbook, and join me on this epic adventure to bring the fascinating worlds of physics, mathematics, and computer science to life through the spellbinding art of game creation! ÔøΩ

Are you ready to embark on this awe-inspiring journey? Let the adventure begin! üéâ

## Goals

The goal is to explore the engaging aspects of physics and mathematics by applying them to game development and real-life simulations. I hope this repository can serve as a guide and inspiration for others who are interested in game development or just to .
